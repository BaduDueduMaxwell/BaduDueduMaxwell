# ♻️ Maxwell Duedu

**`Engineer`**

Hi, I’m Maxwell Duedu-—a full-stack engineer working in fintech. I enjoy working with startups and founders, helping turn ideas into real, usable products. I’ve built clean React interfaces and designed backend systems with Node.js and Python that handle real users and real transactions.

For me, engineering isn’t just about delivering projects-—it’s about building systems, infrastructure, and long-term solutions that actually scale with businesses.

I care a lot about doing things properly—-writing clean code, thinking through solutions, and refining systems until they feel solid and dependable. I enjoy breaking down complex problems and turning them into something practical and reliable.

Feel free to explore my GitHub to see what I’ve been building.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Maxwell’s Coding Journey</h3></summary>

For a long time, I wanted to be a pilot. I liked the idea of control, precision, and responsibility-—being trusted to navigate something complex and get people safely to their destination.

That changed the first time I wrote code in high school. It was just a simple “Hello, World,” but I remember realizing that I could give instructions to a machine and watch it respond exactly the way I designed it to. That same feeling of control and precision I imagined in the cockpit — I found it in engineering.

What started as curiosity quickly turned into obsession. I began exploring how websites worked, how servers communicated, how data moved from frontend to backend. React pulled me into building interfaces. Node.js and PostgreSQL pulled me into system design. Soon, I wasn’t just writing code-—I was thinking about architecture, scalability, and how systems behave under real-world pressure.

Working in fintech shaped me even more. When real money is involved, “almost working” isn’t good enough. Transactions must be consistent. APIs must be predictable. Systems must scale. That environment forced me to think deeper-—about performance, reliability, security, and long-term maintainability.

Over time, my mindset shifted from just delivering features to building infrastructure-—systems that don’t just launch, but grow with businesses. I enjoy the process of refining backend services, improving frontend performance, tightening security, and optimizing developer workflows through automation and CI/CD.

Today, I see engineering the way I once saw flying-—as responsibility. You’re not just writing code; you’re building something people rely on.

And I’m still building.
